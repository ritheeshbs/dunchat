    <p>Most chat tools are a mess. Endless channels, cluttered messages, and a confusing interface that's <span class="text-black">more distracting than helpful.</span></p>

    <p>When you need a clear way to talk to your team, they throw in every extra feature under the sun. But you just want a place where <span class="text-black">everyone can stay on track.</span></p>

    <p>That's why we're making DunChat.</p>
